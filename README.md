# ATMEGA328_ESSENTIALS
Code base for the ATMEGA 328 MCU peripherals.
I made this for those who want to program the ATmega328 without using Arduino IDE.
Use this as a cheatsheet so you can write your own embedded applications in C.

Included Peripherals
- GPIO
- ADC
- Watchdog Timer
- EEPROM
- UART
- I2C
- SPI
